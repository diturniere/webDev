        <p class="main-info">In antiquity, seven wonders of the world were known. In different eras and in different countries, the emergence of a new masterpiece of architecture gave rise to the desire to add some more "miracle number 8" to this list. People called the "eighth wonder of the world" both the creations of nature and the most various engineering structures - the Golden Gate Bridge, the Hoover Dam in the USA, the Eiffel Tower in France, etc. Of the 7 wonders of the Ancient World, only the pyramid of Cheops has survived, however over the past centuries, the golden cultural fund has accumulated many objects worthy of the title of the "eighth miracle".</p>
